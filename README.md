Implementation of parking lot. Not completed work in progress


QUESTION: Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles.

Solution:

          For our purposes right now, we’ll make the following assumptions.
          We made these specific assumptions to add a bit of complexity to the problem without adding too much.
          If you made different assumptions, that’s totally fine.

          1) The parking lot has multiple levels. Each level has multiple rows of spots.
          2) The parking lot can park motorcycles, cars, and buses.
          3) The parking lot has motorcycle spots, compact spots, and large spots.
          4) A motorcycle can park in any spot.
          5) A car can park in either a single compact spot or a single large spot.
          6) A bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and within the same row. It cannot park in small spots.
